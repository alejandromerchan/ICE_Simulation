# ICE_Simulation

This is a simulation of tobacco budworm data based on counts taken in North Carolina tobacco plots by Hannah Burrack's laboratory at NC State university.

The aim of this project was to simulate how insecticide treatmnts affect tobacco budworm counts in tobacco fields. This simulation can be used to test different analysis strategies and to perform power analysis.
